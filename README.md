# Discord Bot
I learned a lot from making this bot and working with the Discord API. Also found out about Nodemon, pretty cool package. First time working with JavaScript, this is by far the most complex language I've learned so far, or maybe it's just because I was working with an API and the code wasn't simple, idk. I can see why JavaScript is so popular, I'll be making my own website soon so good thing I learned it now. 

Invite link for bot => https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=879598602882785300&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands

## Video in Action





have the bot have a command where you can set the loser of the server, and whenever they type (maybe random chance) it tells them how stupid they are with random responses

says you look like this then send image (have file of images)

remind people of how much a piece of shit they are
you know no ones listening, right?

you'll regret adding me on join
