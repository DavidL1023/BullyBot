# Discord Bot
I learned a lot from making this bot and working with the Discord API. Also found out about Nodemon, pretty cool package. First time working with JavaScript, this is by far the most challenging language I've learned so far, or maybe it's just because I was working with an API and the code wasn't too simple, idk. I can see why JavaScript is so popular, I'll be making my own website soon so good thing I learned it now. 

# Dependencies
/ [DiscordJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js) / [Dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)

I also use [Insult](https://www.npmjs.com/package/insult) but it is not required to install with npm it since it is in my source code

## How To Use
Invite link for v13 bot => [Click me!](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=879598602882785300&permissions=0&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

(Warning, the bot is offensive)

This bot basically bullies a target that you select, and each server has its own variables so nothing overlaps. It has a percent chance to pretty much roast the target when they type. Use the bot and find out all of the little details I put into it!

*Should be running 24/7 since I'm using Heroku. To get started type in the help command that the bot has in its profile info.*

*For authorization when using the bot, you must create '.env' file in parent directory and enter this line of code*
--> DISCORDJS_BOT_TOKEN=(*insert bots token from Discord*)

*Also, you can modify the Insult package by finding ./node_modules/insult/data/insults.js, add insults here.*
