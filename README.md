# Discord Bot
I learned a lot from making this bot and working with the Discord API. Also found out about Nodemon, pretty cool package. First time working with JavaScript, this is by far the most complex language I've learned so far, or maybe it's just because I was working with an API and the code wasn't simple, idk. I can see why JavaScript is so popular, I'll be making my own website soon so good thing I learned it now.
