# Discord Bot
This bot basically bullies a target that you select, and each server has its own variables so nothing overlaps. It has a percent chance to roast the target when they type.

# Dependencies
Run npm ci in root directory

I also use [Insult](https://www.npmjs.com/package/insult) but it is not required to install since it is in my source code

## How To Use
